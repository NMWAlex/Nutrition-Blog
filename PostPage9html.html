    <h2 class="sub-heading">Collagen is the most abundant protein in our bodies </h2>
<p class="post-text">How exactly can you benefit from obtaining and making more collagen? Below are some of the key benefits associated with collagen protein:

    1. Supports the Health of Skin and Hair
    Increasing collagen levels may help your skin look firmer, increase smoothness, and help your skin cells keep renewing and repairing normally.
    
    2. Offers Joint Support and Comfort
    It can help your joints move with more ease and help decrease stiffness in joints such as your knees. It may help contribute to enhancements in daily activities, such as walking up stairs, ascending or sleeping.
    
    3. Aids in a Healthy Gut
    Can help promote a healthy gut lining by “sealing up” connective tissue, and support nutrient absorption. It may also help with the absorption of water within the intestines, keeping things moving more freely out of the body.
    
    4. Supports a Healthy Metabolism and Muscles
    A boost in collagen may help support a healthy metabolism by adding lean muscle to your frame and help with the conversion of essential nutrients.
    
    5. Can Aid In Overall Health
    Protein in general is important for healthy muscle tissue, healthy skin, healthy bodily tissues, boosting the metabolism, and aiding in proper growth and development. Some amino acids can also boost the body’s use of antioxidants and support healthy cells from DNA and RNA.
    
    6. Can Help Strengthen Nails, Hair and Teeth
    Collagen protein is the building block of your fingernails, hair and teeth and may support hair follicle health as well.
    
    7. Supports Cardiovascular Health
    AAs in collagen can help to support healthy arteries and healthy normal blood pressure by assisting in normal vasodilation (the widening of arteries and relaxation of muscle cells and blood vessels that allows for healthy circulation).
