    <h2 class="sub-heading">How Much Protein Do I Need?</h2>
<p class="post-text">Essential amino acids (the ones your body can’t make on its own and needs to get from food) can be found in the food you eat, per MedlinePlus. To source them, you need to fill your diet with a variety of protein-rich foods, which isn’t hard to do because protein is naturally found in many nutritious foods — lots of which are likely already part of your regular diet. When you eat, your body will take the protein from the food and break it down into amino acids that can be used by the body.
    Calculate Your Recommended Protein Intake
The recommended dietary allowance (the amount to meet the nutritional needs of almost all healthy people) is 0.8 grams (g) of protein per kilogram (kg) of body weight. To maintain nutritional balance, the U.S. Department of Agriculture's MyPlate guidelines recommends protein make up about one-quarter of your plate.

To calculate the target number of grams of protein you should eat each day, Harvard Health Publishing says take your body weight in pounds and multiply it by 0.36. The result should get you within the recommendation to source 10 to 35 percent of your daily total calories from protein, according to MedlinePlus. Usually that means having some kind of dairy at each meal plus a piece of meat the size of a deck of cards — that’s 3 ounces (oz) — or the equivalent amount of plant-based protein at lunch and dinner, according to Mayo Clinic. 

Keep in mind that these recommendations may change depending on age and health. The recommendation changes for athletes, too. People who exercise frequently or are training for a race need to increase their protein intake to between 1.1 and 1.7 g per kg of body weight daily. Anything over 2 g per kg of weight is considered excessive.
