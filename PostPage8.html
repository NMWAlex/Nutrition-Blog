    <h2 class="sub-heading">The Health Benefits of Vitamin E</h2>
<p class="post-text">Protects the Skin
    Vitamin E has been used for decades in dermatology as a shield to protect the skin from free radical damage. When taken orally, vitamin E helps reduce the time it takes for wounds to heal.17
    
    
    Topically vitamin E is known for its anti-inflammatory properties and is used to promote collagen production. Unfortunately, existing research is varied and inconclusive.18
    
    While it sounds great, expecting vitamin E to clear skin conditions beyond reducing healing time could be a waste of money. A quality skincare routine and a discussion with a dermatologist is the best way to combat skin disorders.19
    
    Possible Side Effects
    Large Doses of Vitamin E
    Vitamin E supplements rarely cause any harm if taken at the recommended daily dose. And research has not found any adverse effects from vitamin E in food.
    
    However, taking vitamin E in doses greater than the RDA of 300 IUs daily puts you at a greater risk of hemorrhagic stroke. One study cautions against the use of vitamin E supplementation as it found vitamin E increased the risk of hemorrhagic stroke by 22%.20
    
    Even doses lower than this can trigger side effects like nausea, vomiting, stomach pain, and diarrhea.21
    
    Interactions with Medications
    Vitamin E prevents platelet aggregation, meaning it slows blood clotting. Talk to a healthcare professional before taking vitamin E if you take blood thinners, including Coumadin (warfarin) or Plavix (clopidogrel), especially if you have low vitamin K intake.22
    
    Additionally, avoid taking vitamin E at least two weeks before surgery to prevent excessive bleeding.
    
    Vitamin E may also interact with certain medications, including the immune-suppressive drug Sandimmune (cyclosporine), certain chemotherapy drugs, statin drugs like Lipitor (atorvastatin), and tamoxifen.23
    
    Use During Pregnancy or Breastfeeding
    Vitamin E is generally found to be safe for pregnant or breastfeeding people.22 Always speak with a health care provider before taking any new supplements or medications.
    
    May Prevent Coronary Heart Disease
    Whether vitamin E prevents coronary heart disease (CVD) in the general population has yet to be determined. Much of the existing research contradicts findings suggesting vitamin E supplementation in high-risk patients is beneficial. In contrast, other research indicates that vitamin E does not improve cardiovascular risk factors.2
    
    According to a review published in the Journal of Lipid Research, administering vitamin E supplementation may be cardioprotective for those with high levels of oxidative stress, including those with type 2 diabetes and those undergoing hemodialysis.3
    
    Interestingly, a 2019 study determined quite the opposite: supplementing with vitamin E had adverse effects on coronary artery disease (CAD). Scientists found that higher vitamin E levels may increase the CAD risk.4
    
    At this time, more research is needed to determine the effects of vitamin E on cardiovascular risk factors. Talk with your cardiologist before taking vitamin E to improve heart health.
    
    Finally, the American Heart Association does not promote the usage of vitamin E supplementation to prevent cardiovascular disease as it may be associated with an increase in total mortality, heart failure, and hemorrhagic stroke. However, they suggest eating foods rich in vitamin E and other antioxidant nutrients to promote heart health.5
    
    Could Reduce Risk of Developing Certain Cancers
    Another controversial benefit of vitamin E is its effect on cancer. Vitamin E is a powerful antioxidant that prevents and fights free radical oxidation and damage to cells which may play a role in developing cancer and other health conditions.6
    
    Research on whether or not vitamin E prevents or promotes cancer is still emerging and is specific to the form of vitamin E and its bioavailability. Evidence suggests that lower vitamin E intake is associated with increased cancer risk.7
    
    Other reviews have examined the type of vitamin E (tocopherols and tocotrienols) on cancer risk. They have found that a gamma-tocopherol-rich mixture of vitamin E tocopherols is a promising anti-cancer agent and should be studied further.8
    
    On the other hand, some evidence does not support the supplementation of vitamin E for cancer prevention. One study examined the effect of vitamin E supplementation on the risk of prostate cancer and showed that vitamin E is not a good prevention method for cancer. This study also determined that vitamin E may increase the risk of prostate cancer.9
    
    More research is needed to determine whether vitamin E can help prevent cancer.
    
    May Prevent or Treat Eye Disorders
    Macular degeneration (AMD) and cataracts are the most common age-related eye diseases associated with oxidative stress and free radical damage. Vitamin E's antioxidant activity makes it an ideal candidate for preventing and treating both AMD and cataracts.
    
    One review investigated the benefits of antioxidant micronutrients on eye health and macular degeneration. It found that vitamin E helps reduce the cellular oxidative stress of the retina or macular region of the eye. Additional studies have found a correlation between increased dietary vitamin E and AMD's slower progression rate.10
    
    In addition, vitamin E aids in the self-repair of the retina, cornea, and uvea (the pigmented portion of the eye). A 2015 review of studies published in Public Health Nutrition concluded that vitamin E supplementation was associated with a reduced risk of aging-related cataracts.11
    
    Though the evidence is promising for vitamin E and the prevention of age-related eye disorders, more research is needed.
    
    May Prevent or Delay Cognitive Decline
    Cognitive health refers to how well you think, learn, and remember things.12 A balanced, nutritious diet is at the forefront of maintaining good cognitive health and preventing age-related cognitive deterioration, including dementia and Alzheimer's.
    
    It's been postulated that foods rich in antioxidant vitamins would slow the onset of Alzheimer's disease. However, the research is not clear on whether supplementing with antioxidant vitamins, including vitamin E, is only beneficial for those with antioxidant vitamin deficiencies.13
    
    However, one study did see a slight decline in the incidence of Alzheimer's disease when supplementing with vitamin E.14
    
    Another study hypothesized that supplementation with vitamin E in patients with Alzheimer's disease could protect against oxidative damage, reduce neuronal damage, and slow the progression of Alzheimer's disease. After two years of supplementing with 2000 IUs per day of vitamin E, researchers found that they were able to slow the progression of the disease.15
    
    A similar study over three years found that vitamin E had no benefit in patients with mild cognitive impairment. And the rate of progression of Alzheimer's disease did not change.16
    
    More research is needed to determine whether supplementing with vitamin E will slow the onset or progression of age-related cognitive decline. However, those with a deficiency would benefit from supplementing with alpha-tocopherol vitamin E.
