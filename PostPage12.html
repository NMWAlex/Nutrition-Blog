    <h2 class="sub-heading">Vitamin B6: foods, functions, how much do you need & more</h2>
<p class="post-text">Vitamin B6 is the generic name used for a group of water-soluble compounds that belong to the family of B-vitamins. We can find vitamin B6 in a variety of foods.

    What are the functions of vitamin B6?
    Vitamin B6 is involved in more than 100 chemical reactions in our cells. Our bodies use vitamin B6 to convert nutrients into energy, to create our red blood cells, to form our genetic material (DNA and RNA) and to break down an excess of homocysteine, an amino acid that can put us at higher risk of cardiovascular disease, when present in high amounts.
    
    This vitamin is also important to keep the healthy function of our brain and nervous system and supports the normal development of our brain during pregnancy and infancy.
    How much vitamin B6 do I need per day?
    How much vitamin B6 you need per day changes according to your age, sex and life-stage.
    
    The dietary reference value (DRV) for healthy adults (over the age of 18), including during pregnancy and lactation, is between for 1.6-1.8 mg of vitamin B6 per day.
    
    Following your country's dietary guidelines on a healthy and balanced diet will help you meet your needs for vitamin B6.
    
    What foods contain vitamin B6?
    We can find vitamin B6 in a variety of foods but some of its richest sources include:
    
    wholegrains (such as corn/maize, brown rice, sorghum and quinoa)
    pulses
    nuts and seeds,
    potatoes
    meat and meat products (such as poultry, pork and liver)
    fortified foods.
    Vitamin B6 can also be found in smaller amounts in green vegetables.
    
    Some herbs and spices (such as garlic, curry and ginger) are also rich in vitamin B6: however, they donâ€™t really increase our intake of this vitamin because we only eat them in very small amounts.
