     What Is Protein?
   </a>

        <span class="post-date">6 Sept 2022</span>
 <p class="post-description">
Protein is found throughout the body—in muscle, bone, skin, hair, and virtually every other body part or tissue. It makes up the enzymes that power many chemical reactions and the hemoglobin that carries oxygen in your blood. At least 10,000 different proteins make you what you are and keep you that way.

Protein is made from twenty-plus basic building blocks called amino acids. Because we don’t store amino acids, our bodies make them in two different ways: either from scratch, or by modifying others. Nine amino acids—histidine, isoleucine, leucine, lysine, methionine, phenylalanine, threonine, tryptophan, and valine—known as the essential amino acids, must come from food.

          Iron-Rich Foods
   </a>

        <span class="post-date">6 Sept 2022</span>
 <p class="post-description">Spinach may not give you superhuman strength to fight off villains like Popeye's nemesis Bluto, but this leafy green and other foods containing iron can help you fight a different type of enemy -- iron-deficiency anemia.

  Iron-deficiency anemia, the most common form of anemia, is a decrease in the number of red blood cells caused by too little iron. Without sufficient iron, your body can't produce enough hemoglobin, a substance in red blood cells that makes it possible for them to carry oxygen to the body's tissues. As a result, you may feel weak, tired, and irritable.
  
  About 20% of women, 50% of pregnant women, and 3% of men do not have enough iron in their body. The solution, in many cases, is to consume more foods high in iron.
  
  How Your Body Uses Iron in Food
  When you eat food with iron, iron is absorbed into your body mainly through the upper part of your small intestine.
  
  There are two forms of dietary iron: heme and nonheme. Heme iron is derived from hemoglobin. It is found in animal foods that originally contained hemoglobin, such as red meats, fish, and poultry (meat, poultry, and seafood contain both heme and non-heme iron). Your body absorbs the most iron from heme sources. Most nonheme iron is from plant sources.
  
  Iron-Rich Foods
  Very good sources of heme iron, with 3.5 milligrams or more per serving, include:
  
  3 ounces of beef or chicken liver
  3 ounces of mussels
  3 ounces of oysters
  Good sources of heme iron, with 2.1 milligrams or more per serving, include:
  
  3 ounces of cooked beef
  3 ounces of canned sardines, canned in oil
  Other sources of heme iron, with 0.6 milligrams or more per serving, include:
  
  3 ounces of chicken
  3 ounces of cooked turkey
  3 ounces of ham
  3 ounces of veal
  Other sources of heme iron, with 0.3 milligrams or more per serving, include:
  
  3 ounces of haddock, perch, salmon, or tuna
  Iron in plant foods such as lentils, beans, and spinach is nonheme iron. This is the form of iron added to iron-enriched and iron-fortified foods. Our bodies are less efficient at absorbing nonheme iron, but most dietary iron is nonheme iron.
  
  Very good sources of nonheme iron, with 3.5 milligrams or more per serving, include:
  
  Breakfast cereals enriched with iron
  One cup of cooked beans
  One-half cup of tofu
  Good sources of nonheme iron, with 2.1 milligrams or more per serving, include:
  
  One-half cup of canned lima beans, red kidney beans, or chickpeas
  One cup of dried apricots
  One cup of cooked enriched egg noodles
  One-fourth cup of wheat germ
  1 ounce of pumpkin, sesame, or squash seeds
  Other sources of nonheme iron, with 0.7 milligrams or more, include:
  
  One-half cup of cooked split peas
  1 ounce of peanuts, pecans, walnuts, pistachios, roasted almonds, roasted cashews, or sunflower seeds
  One-half cup of dried seedless raisins, peaches, or prunes
  One medium stalk of broccoli
  One cup of raw spinach
  One cup of pasta (cooked, it becomes 3-4 cups)
  One slice of bread, half of a small pumpernickel bagel, or bran muffin
  One cup of brown or enriched rice
   
  
  How to Get More Iron From Your Food
  Some foods can help your body absorb iron from iron-rich foods; others can hinder it. To absorb the most iron from the foods you eat, avoid drinking coffee or tea or consuming calcium-rich foods or drinks with meals containing iron-rich foods. Calcium itself can interfere.To improve your absorption of iron, eat it along with a good source of vitamin C -- such as orange juice, broccoli, or strawberries -- or eat nonheme iron foods with a food from the meat, fish, and poultry group.
  
  If you have trouble getting enough iron from food sources, you may need an iron supplement. But speak to your health care provider about the proper dosage first and follow their instructions carefully. Because very little iron is excreted from the body, iron can accumulate in body tissues and organs when the normal storage sites -- the liver, spleen, and bone marrow -- are full. Although iron toxicity from food sources is rare, deadly overdoses are possible with supplements.</p>

        <a href="PostPage3.html" class="post-title">What are Carbohydrates?
    
   </a>

        <span class="post-date">6 Sept 2022</span>
 <p class="post-description">What are the different types of carbohydrates?
  Carbohydrates, or carbs, are sugar molecules. Along with proteins and fats, carbohydrates are one of three main nutrients found in foods and drinks.

  Your body breaks down carbohydrates into glucose. Glucose, or blood sugar, is the main source of energy for your body's cells, tissues, and organs. Glucose can be used immediately or stored in the liver and muscles for later use.
  
  What are the different types of carbohydrates?
  There are three main types of carbohydrates:
  
  Sugars. They are also called simple carbohydrates because they are in the most basic form. They can be added to foods, such as the sugar in candy, desserts, processed foods, and regular soda. They also include the kinds of sugar that are found naturally in fruits, vegetables, and milk.
  Starches. They are complex carbohydrates, which are made of lots of simple sugars strung together. Your body needs to break starches down into sugars to use them for energy. Starches include bread, cereal, and pasta. They also include certain vegetables, like potatoes, peas, and corn.
  Fiber. It is also a complex carbohydrate. Your body cannot break down most fibers, so eating foods with fiber can help you feel full and make you less likely to overeat. Diets high in fiber have other health benefits. They may help prevent stomach or intestinal problems, such as constipation. They may also help lower cholesterol and blood sugar. Fiber is found in many foods that come from plants, including fruits, vegetables, nuts, seeds, beans, and whole grains.
  Which foods have carbohydrates?
  Common foods with carbohydrates include:
  
  Grains, such as bread, noodles, pasta, crackers, cereals, and rice
  Fruits, such as apples, bananas, berries, mangoes, melons, and oranges
  Dairy products, such as milk and yogurt
  Legumes, including dried beans, lentils, and peas
  Snack foods and sweets, such as cakes, cookies, candy, and other desserts
  Juices, regular sodas, fruit drinks, sports drinks, and energy drinks that contain sugar
  Starchy vegetables, such as potatoes, corn, and peas
  Some foods don't have a lot of carbohydrates, such as meat, fish, poultry, some types of cheese, nuts, and oils.
  
  Which types of carbohydrates should I eat?
  You do need to eat some carbohydrates to give your body energy. But it's important to eat the right kinds of carbohydrates for your health:
  
  When eating grains, choose mostly whole grains and not refined grains:
  Whole grains are foods like whole wheat bread, brown rice, whole cornmeal, and oatmeal. They offer lots of nutrients that your body needs, like vitamins, minerals, and fiber. To figure out whether a product has a lot of whole grain, check the ingredients list on the package and see if a whole grain is one of the first few items listed.
  Refined grains are foods that have had some parts of the grains removed. This also removes some of the nutrients that are good for your health.
  Eat foods with lots of fiber. The Nutrition Facts labels on the back of food packages tells you how much fiber a product has.
  Try to avoid foods that have a lot of added sugar. These foods can have many calories but not much nutrition. Eating too much added sugar raises your blood sugar and can make you gain weight. You can tell if a food or drink has added sugars by looking at the Nutrition Facts label on the back of the food package. It tells you how much total sugar and added sugar is in that food or drink.

   </a>

        <span class="post-date">6 Sept 2022</span>
 <p class="post-description">A deficiency or insufficiency can occur when levels of vitamin B12 become too low to meet the demands of the body. This can lead to a number of symptoms and can even progress to irreversible neurological issues if left untreated.

In the United States and United Kingdom, approximately 6%Trusted Source of adults aged 60 or younger have vitamin B12 deficiency. The rate jumps to 20% in people older than 60.

Vitamin B12 is a water-soluble vitamin, like all other B vitamins. This means it can dissolve in water and travel through the bloodstream. The body can store vitamin B12 for up to 4 years, and it can get rid of any excess or unwanted vitamin B12 in the urine.

Vitamin B12 is the largest and most structurally complicated vitamin. It occurs naturally in animal products like meat and eggs, and manufacturers can produce it through bacterial fermentation synthesis.

This article explores the functions of vitamin B12, how a person would know they are not consuming enough vitamin B12, and how to increase intake.

        <a href="PostPage5.html" class="post-title">Why You Need Vitamin B1? 
   </a>

        <span class="post-date">6 Sept 2022</span>
 <p class="post-description">Thiamine, or vitamin B1, is essential for your health. 

The daily amount of thiamin you need depends on your age and sex, but it is recommended that adult men get 1.2 mg and women get 1.1 mg. Various foods and supplements can provide your daily value of thiamine.

Vitamin B1 helps your body function in many different ways, including:

Metabolism

Thiamine helps turn carbohydrates into energy. It is required for the metabolism of glucose, amino acids, and lipids.

Pregnancy

Thiamine is recommended for people with low levels of thiamine, including those with thiamine deficiency syndromes and pregnant women.

Vitamin B1 also plays an important role in the brain development of babies in the womb.

Memory

Chronic alcohol use can lead to thiamine deficiency, which sometimes causes brain damage and memory loss. Healthcare workers use thiamine to treat such conditions.

Foods With Thiamine
1. Legumes

Legumes are a rich source of thiamine and other B vitamins. They contain many other nutrients, including:  Half a cup of boiled black beans gives you 27% of your daily value of thiamine.

Fiber
Protein
Iron
Copper
Magnesium
Manganese
Zinc
Phosphorous
2. Whole Grain Bread and Pasta

When bread or pasta is labeled "100% whole grain," that means the product was made with the entire wheat kernel. As opposed to those made with processed flour, these products contain far more nutrients, including vitamin B1.

3. Fortified Breakfast Cereal

Because processing removes some of the thiamine content from grains, many companies enrich their products with vitamin B1 later. One such product is breakfast cereal. In industrial countries where fortification is widespread, fortified foods provide about 50% of the total thiamine intake.

4. Liver

In meat, liver has the highest amount of thiamine. Whereas three ounces of beef steak gives you 7% of your daily value of thiamine, one serving of beef liver will give you about 10%.

5. Salmon

One serving of cooked salmon gives you 18% of your daily value of thiamine. Salmon is also full of protein, omega-3 fatty acids, and vitamin D.

        <a href="PostPage6.html" class="post-title">Healthy Foods High in Vitamin A
    
   </a>

        <span class="post-date">6 Sept 2022</span>
 <p class="post-description">Vitamin A is essential for your health in a number of ways. Your body cannot produce vitamin A from scratch, which makes it an essential micronutrient. That means that you need to get this vitamin from your food. On average, adults need between 700 and 900 micrograms (mcg) of vitamin A every day to avoid a deficiency.

Vitamin A plays an important role in many body systems, including:

Eye H ealth

Vitamin A is so important to your eyes that it is also known as “retinol,” after the word “retina.” Sufficient Vitamin A intake helps maintain the health of your retinas and helps prevent age-related macular degeneration. 

Immune Health

Your immune system is a complex collection of different cells that keep you healthy. Vitamin A plays a critical role in helping these cells communicate and regulate themselves effectively.

Reproductive H ealth

Vitamin A helps with multiple aspects of the human reproductive system. Getting enough of the vitamin in your diet helps prevent birth defects and reduces the risk of infertility for all genders.

Foods With Vitamin A
Many foods are rich in vitamin A, so it’s generally easy to get your daily requirement of this vitamin from your diet. These eight foods are some of the best sources of dietary vitamin A available.

Liver
Liver is the richest source of vitamin A outside of supplements. A single three-ounce serving of cooked liver contains as much as 6600 mcg of vitamin A, or more than 700% of your daily requirement. Liver is such an effective source of vitamin A that some sources recommend eating liver no more than once a week to avoid consuming too much of the vitamin.

Dairy
Dairy in general is an excellent source of vitamin A on its own. In the US, though, many types of dairy milk are actually fortified with additional vitamin A. Depending on the dairy source, a single serving can have between 100 and 300 mcg of vitamin A. 

Sweet Potato
A single whole sweet potato contains an impressive 1400 mcg of vitamin A in its skin. That’s more than 150% of your daily requirement in a single serving. For people following plant-based diets, this makes sweet potato an invaluable source of vitamin A. 

Spinach
Spinach is known as a nutrient powerhouse for a reason. A single half-cup serving of spinach contains more than 570 mcg of vitamin A. Whether you’re eating it raw, in a smoothie, or cooked into a dish, spinach is a great way to get fiber and vitamin A at the same time. 

Carrots
Like many other orange foods, carrots are an excellent source of beta-carotene. A half-cup of raw carrots contains more than 450 mcg of vitamin A. This is part of the reason why carrots are touted as good for your eyesight.

Squash
All forms of yellow squash include some vitamin A, but pumpkin is king when it comes to this nutrient. A slice of pumpkin pie can have as much as 480 mcg of vitamin A, which is more than half your daily requirement. 

Peppers
When it comes to vitamin A, the color of your peppers matters. Red sweet peppers contain a significant amount of vitamin A, nearly 120 mcg in a half-cup serving. On the other hand, green peppers come in at only 18 mcg — a big difference. Swapping the color of peppers in your food is an easy change that has big nutritional dividends.

Cantaloupe
Vitamin A can break down when heated, so raw sources of this nutrient are important. Cantaloupe almost always consumed raw, so adding some of this melon to your diet can increase your vitamin A intake. A half-cup of cantaloupe has 135 mcg of vitamin A per serving.

        <a href="PostPage7.html" class="post-title">How Much Vitamin C Should You Get Every Day?
   </a>

        <span class="post-date">6 Sept 2022</span>
 <p class="post-description">Vitamin C, also known as ascorbic acid, has several important functions.

  These include:
  
  helping to protect cells and keeping them healthy
  maintaining healthy skin, blood vessels, bones and cartilage
  helping with wound healing
  Lack of vitamin C can lead to scurvy.
  
  Good sources of vitamin C
  Vitamin C is found in a wide variety of fruit and vegetables.
  
  Good sources include:
  
  citrus fruit, such as oranges and orange juice
  peppers
  strawberries
  blackcurrants
  broccoli
  brussels sprouts
  potatoes
  How much vitamin C do I need?
  Adults aged 19 to 64 need 40mg of vitamin C a day.
  
  You should be able to get all the vitamin C you need from your daily diet.
  
  Vitamin C cannot be stored in the body, so you need it in your diet every day.
  
  What happens if I take too much vitamin C?
  Taking large amounts (more than 1,000mg per day) of vitamin C can cause:
  
  stomach pain
  diarrhoea
  flatulence
  These symptoms should disappear once you stop taking vitamin C supplements.
  
  What does the Department of Health and Social Care advise?
  You should be able to get all the vitamin C you need by eating a varied and balanced diet.
  
  If you take vitamin C supplements, do not take too much as this could be harmful.
  
  Taking less than 1,000mg of vitamin C supplements a day is unlikely to cause any harm.

        <a href="PostPage8.html" class="post-title">The Health Benefits of Vitamin E
    
   </a>

        <span class="post-date">6 Sept 2022</span>
 <p class="post-description">Protects the Skin
Vitamin E has been used for decades in dermatology as a shield to protect the skin from free radical damage. When taken orally, vitamin E helps reduce the time it takes for wounds to heal.17


Topically vitamin E is known for its anti-inflammatory properties and is used to promote collagen production. Unfortunately, existing research is varied and inconclusive.18

While it sounds great, expecting vitamin E to clear skin conditions beyond reducing healing time could be a waste of money. A quality skincare routine and a discussion with a dermatologist is the best way to combat skin disorders.19

Possible Side Effects
Large Doses of Vitamin E
Vitamin E supplements rarely cause any harm if taken at the recommended daily dose. And research has not found any adverse effects from vitamin E in food.

However, taking vitamin E in doses greater than the RDA of 300 IUs daily puts you at a greater risk of hemorrhagic stroke. One study cautions against the use of vitamin E supplementation as it found vitamin E increased the risk of hemorrhagic stroke by 22%.20

Even doses lower than this can trigger side effects like nausea, vomiting, stomach pain, and diarrhea.21

Interactions with Medications
Vitamin E prevents platelet aggregation, meaning it slows blood clotting. Talk to a healthcare professional before taking vitamin E if you take blood thinners, including Coumadin (warfarin) or Plavix (clopidogrel), especially if you have low vitamin K intake.22

Additionally, avoid taking vitamin E at least two weeks before surgery to prevent excessive bleeding.

Vitamin E may also interact with certain medications, including the immune-suppressive drug Sandimmune (cyclosporine), certain chemotherapy drugs, statin drugs like Lipitor (atorvastatin), and tamoxifen.23

Use During Pregnancy or Breastfeeding
Vitamin E is generally found to be safe for pregnant or breastfeeding people.22 Always speak with a health care provider before taking any new supplements or medications.

May Prevent Coronary Heart Disease
Whether vitamin E prevents coronary heart disease (CVD) in the general population has yet to be determined. Much of the existing research contradicts findings suggesting vitamin E supplementation in high-risk patients is beneficial. In contrast, other research indicates that vitamin E does not improve cardiovascular risk factors.2

According to a review published in the Journal of Lipid Research, administering vitamin E supplementation may be cardioprotective for those with high levels of oxidative stress, including those with type 2 diabetes and those undergoing hemodialysis.3

Interestingly, a 2019 study determined quite the opposite: supplementing with vitamin E had adverse effects on coronary artery disease (CAD). Scientists found that higher vitamin E levels may increase the CAD risk.4

At this time, more research is needed to determine the effects of vitamin E on cardiovascular risk factors. Talk with your cardiologist before taking vitamin E to improve heart health.

Finally, the American Heart Association does not promote the usage of vitamin E supplementation to prevent cardiovascular disease as it may be associated with an increase in total mortality, heart failure, and hemorrhagic stroke. However, they suggest eating foods rich in vitamin E and other antioxidant nutrients to promote heart health.5

Could Reduce Risk of Developing Certain Cancers
Another controversial benefit of vitamin E is its effect on cancer. Vitamin E is a powerful antioxidant that prevents and fights free radical oxidation and damage to cells which may play a role in developing cancer and other health conditions.6

Research on whether or not vitamin E prevents or promotes cancer is still emerging and is specific to the form of vitamin E and its bioavailability. Evidence suggests that lower vitamin E intake is associated with increased cancer risk.7

Other reviews have examined the type of vitamin E (tocopherols and tocotrienols) on cancer risk. They have found that a gamma-tocopherol-rich mixture of vitamin E tocopherols is a promising anti-cancer agent and should be studied further.8

On the other hand, some evidence does not support the supplementation of vitamin E for cancer prevention. One study examined the effect of vitamin E supplementation on the risk of prostate cancer and showed that vitamin E is not a good prevention method for cancer. This study also determined that vitamin E may increase the risk of prostate cancer.9

More research is needed to determine whether vitamin E can help prevent cancer.

May Prevent or Treat Eye Disorders
Macular degeneration (AMD) and cataracts are the most common age-related eye diseases associated with oxidative stress and free radical damage. Vitamin E's antioxidant activity makes it an ideal candidate for preventing and treating both AMD and cataracts.

One review investigated the benefits of antioxidant micronutrients on eye health and macular degeneration. It found that vitamin E helps reduce the cellular oxidative stress of the retina or macular region of the eye. Additional studies have found a correlation between increased dietary vitamin E and AMD's slower progression rate.10

In addition, vitamin E aids in the self-repair of the retina, cornea, and uvea (the pigmented portion of the eye). A 2015 review of studies published in Public Health Nutrition concluded that vitamin E supplementation was associated with a reduced risk of aging-related cataracts.11

Though the evidence is promising for vitamin E and the prevention of age-related eye disorders, more research is needed.

May Prevent or Delay Cognitive Decline
Cognitive health refers to how well you think, learn, and remember things.12 A balanced, nutritious diet is at the forefront of maintaining good cognitive health and preventing age-related cognitive deterioration, including dementia and Alzheimer's.

It's been postulated that foods rich in antioxidant vitamins would slow the onset of Alzheimer's disease. However, the research is not clear on whether supplementing with antioxidant vitamins, including vitamin E, is only beneficial for those with antioxidant vitamin deficiencies.13

However, one study did see a slight decline in the incidence of Alzheimer's disease when supplementing with vitamin E.14

Another study hypothesized that supplementation with vitamin E in patients with Alzheimer's disease could protect against oxidative damage, reduce neuronal damage, and slow the progression of Alzheimer's disease. After two years of supplementing with 2000 IUs per day of vitamin E, researchers found that they were able to slow the progression of the disease.15

A similar study over three years found that vitamin E had no benefit in patients with mild cognitive impairment. And the rate of progression of Alzheimer's disease did not change.16

More research is needed to determine whether supplementing with vitamin E will slow the onset or progression of age-related cognitive decline. However, those with a deficiency would benefit from supplementing with alpha-tocopherol vitamin E.

 <p class="post-description">How exactly can you benefit from obtaining and making more collagen? Below are some of the key benefits associated with collagen protein:

1. Supports the Health of Skin and Hair
Increasing collagen levels may help your skin look firmer, increase smoothness, and help your skin cells keep renewing and repairing normally.

2. Offers Joint Support and Comfort
It can help your joints move with more ease and help decrease stiffness in joints such as your knees. It may help contribute to enhancements in daily activities, such as walking up stairs, ascending or sleeping.

3. Aids in a Healthy Gut
Can help promote a healthy gut lining by “sealing up” connective tissue, and support nutrient absorption. It may also help with the absorption of water within the intestines, keeping things moving more freely out of the body.

4. Supports a Healthy Metabolism and Muscles
A boost in collagen may help support a healthy metabolism by adding lean muscle to your frame and help with the conversion of essential nutrients.

5. Can Aid In Overall Health
Protein in general is important for healthy muscle tissue, healthy skin, healthy bodily tissues, boosting the metabolism, and aiding in proper growth and development. Some amino acids can also boost the body’s use of antioxidants and support healthy cells from DNA and RNA.

6. Can Help Strengthen Nails, Hair and Teeth
Collagen protein is the building block of your fingernails, hair and teeth and may support hair follicle health as well.

7. Supports Cardiovascular Health
AAs in collagen can help to support healthy arteries and healthy normal blood pressure by assisting in normal vasodilation (the widening of arteries and relaxation of muscle cells and blood vessels that allows for healthy circulation).

Ancient Nutrition's new Multi Collagen Protein formula is the only one with a collagen ingredient and a probiotic ingredient backed by multiple human clinical trials and is proven to deliver real results.

This first-of-its-kind collagen formula …

Improves the appearance of crow's feet after 28 days and skin tone after 8 weeks

Reduces knee stiffness in a week

Reduces exercise-induced stiffness and discomfort

Promotes healthy hair thickness and growth while reducing hair breakage

Improves exercise recovery by 53%

Rapidly reduces joint discomfort in 7 days

Improves stiffness and knee function at 30 days

        <a href="PostPage10.html" class="post-title">Vitamin K is an essential vitamin found in plants or produced from intestinal bacteria.
    
   </a>

        <span class="post-date">6 Sept 2022</span>
 <p class="post-description">Vitamin K is an essential vitamin. It is one of the four fat-soluble vitamins, along with vitamin A, vitamin D, and vitamin E. It was named vitamin K after the German word koagulation, because vitamin K’s role in blood coagulation was first discovered in Germany. Vitamin K can be found in dark green vegetables, matcha tea, and natto (a type of fermented soybeans). Vitamin K can also be found in various animal products.
The Recommended Daily Intake (RDI) of vitamin K is sufficient to support healthy blood coagulation. Higher levels of vitamin K, however, may provide additional benefits. Unfortunately, it can be difficult to obtain high levels of vitamin K from food alone. Most people don’t like natto enough to eat 50g a day, so supplementation of vitamin K is a popular option.
Vitamin K has at times been found to improve markers of bone health. Despite this, supplementation has inconsistent effects on bone fracture risk.
Vitamin K has been suggested to protect cardiovascular health by reducing the calcification and stiffening of arteries. However, a number of clinical trials have found no apparent effect of vitamin K supplementation on arterial calcification. Most of these trials were on people with extensive arterial calcification already present, meaning additional research is needed to determine if vitamin K can prevent tissue calcification before it has started.
Vitamin K may have a role to play in cancer therapy. It may also help with regulating insulin sensitivity and (in topical form) may help reduce skin reddening, but more research is needed before strong conclusions can be drawn.
Vitamin K’s main mechanism is through the vitamin K cycle, which is a cyclical metabolic pathway that uses vitamin K to modify various proteins. Specifically, vitamin K is used to attach a carbon dioxide molecule onto a glutamate contained in these proteins, allowing the protein to bind calcium ions. These proteins can then utilize calcium ions for various biological processes.
Vitamin K is often supplemented alongside vitamin D, since vitamin D also supports bone health. In fact, taking both together may improve the effects of each, since they are believed to work synergistically. Excessive vitamin D can lead to arterial calcification and in animal models vitamin K reduces this buildup.

        <a href="PostPage11.html" class="post-title">What Is Vitamin D?
    
   </a>

        <span class="post-date">6 Sept 2022</span>
 <p class="post-description">Vitamin D is a nutrient needed for health and to maintain strong bones. Vitamin D aids in the absorption of calcium and phosphorus in our bodies, helps bring calcium and phosphorus to our bones and teeth, and helps regulate how much calcium remains in our blood. Together with calcium, vitamin D helps protect against the loss of bone mass.

Vitamin D's importance does not end there. It is also helps muscles function and allows the brain and body to communicate through nerves. The immune system also uses vitamin D to help fight off invading bacteria and viruses. There are three ways to get vitamin D: the sun, through food and drinks or with supplements.

Vitamin D from the Sun
Known as the "sunshine vitamin," your body converts sunlight into vitamin D after it hits unprotected skin. However, be careful to avoid extended exposure to sunlight without sunscreen.

Vitamin D from Food and Drinks
Very few foods naturally have vitamin D. Fatty fish such as salmon and mackerel are among the best sources of vitamin D. Beef liver, cheese and egg yolk provide small amounts. Mushrooms also contain this vitamin if grown under UV lights.

Fortified foods and drinks provide most of the vitamin D in our diets. Most milk and some cereals are fortified with vitamin D, as are many plant-based beverages, like soymilk. Orange juice, yogurt and cheese may or may not be fortified, so it is always good practice to check the Nutrition Facts Label for vitamin D content.

Vitamin D from Supplements
Some individuals may need extra vitamin D, such as older adults; breastfed infants; people with dark skin; those with certain medical conditions including liver disease, cystic fibrosis, celiac disease and Crohn's disease; and those with obesity or who have had gastric bypass surgery. Always check with your health care provider before taking a vitamin D supplement.

        <a href="PostPage12.html" class="post-title">Vitamin B6: foods, functions, how much do you need & more
    
   </a>

        <span class="post-date">6 Sept 2022</span>
 <p class="post-description">What is vitamin B6?
Vitamin B6 is the generic name used for a group of water-soluble compounds that belong to the family of B-vitamins. We can find vitamin B6 in a variety of foods.

What are the functions of vitamin B6?
Vitamin B6 is involved in more than 100 chemical reactions in our cells. Our bodies use vitamin B6 to convert nutrients into energy, to create our red blood cells, to form our genetic material (DNA and RNA) and to break down an excess of homocysteine, an amino acid that can put us at higher risk of cardiovascular disease, when present in high amounts.

This vitamin is also important to keep the healthy function of our brain and nervous system and supports the normal development of our brain during pregnancy and infancy.
How much vitamin B6 do I need per day?
How much vitamin B6 you need per day changes according to your age, sex and life-stage.

The dietary reference value (DRV) for healthy adults (over the age of 18), including during pregnancy and lactation, is between for 1.6-1.8 mg of vitamin B6 per day.

Following your country's dietary guidelines on a healthy and balanced diet will help you meet your needs for vitamin B6.

What foods contain vitamin B6?
We can find vitamin B6 in a variety of foods but some of its richest sources include:

wholegrains (such as corn/maize, brown rice, sorghum and quinoa)
pulses
nuts and seeds,
potatoes
meat and meat products (such as poultry, pork and liver)
fortified foods.
Vitamin B6 can also be found in smaller amounts in green vegetables.

Some herbs and spices (such as garlic, curry and ginger) are also rich in vitamin B6: however, they don’t really increase our intake of this vitamin because we only eat them in very small amounts.
